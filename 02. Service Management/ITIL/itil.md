Service provides present their services to consumers in the form of service offerings, which describe one or mode services based on one or mode products.

But other sources may have another view to services

At the same time, a differentiation between a general service (e.g., the installation service of a service technician), a technical service (e.g., the transmission service of a mobile network) and a service as a product (e.g., consisting of general and technical services) is important. In fact, the term service is used for all three different types.

From an economic perspective, the telecommunications industry belongs to
the service industry and, accordingly, a service will be provided to the customer (Zeithaml and Bitner 2003, p. 3). As shown in Fig. 2.14, only a subset of the services is perceived by the customer. All other services are executed within the telecommunications network as well as the telecommunications system, and are not visible to the customer product should be used to describe a telecommunication service that is provided to a customer.

To achieve the maximum value from the SVS and to properly address the issue of organizational silos, it is preferable to include the whole organization in the scope rather that a subset

## Relationship Systems Intelligence™
>Relationship Systems Intelligence™ incorporates Emotional and Social Intelligence and then expands
the focus to a larger paradigm, the capacity to see oneself as part of a Relationship System. A
Relationship System is an interdependent group of people with common identity or function.
Identifying with and aligning with a system is a holonic shift up from simply connecting effectively
others. It is the difference between relating with bunch of individuals in a group, to seeing the group as
a single integrated whole.

### Steps for RSI:
1. Practicing Deep Democracy where all voices in a system are heard and honored,
including the unpopular ones.
2. Practicing Appreciative Inquiry where one builds on ideas after appreciating what was
said by the other parties.
3. Increasing positivity on a team until there is a 5:1 ratio of positive-to-¬negative
interactions (Gottman 2002).
4. Decreasing negative interactions with softer start ups in difficult conversations and both
understanding and using repair bids (Gottman 2002).
5. Increasing positivity during conflict so that a lighter field is held, even during serious or
difficult conversations.
6. Avoiding toxic communication styles including: blaming, defensiveness, stonewalling,
contempt and controlling (Gottman 2002).
